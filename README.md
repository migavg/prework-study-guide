# Challenge-3 Password Generator

## Description

This week’s challenge was to create a random password generator using JavaScript.

Using JavaScript and the provided starter code I managed to make something that barely resembles a password generator. 

While creating this application I struggled a lot with how to start the application along with keeping up with what variables did what and what they contained.

The majority of my time was figuring out how a for loop ran and how it would randomly select string characters with the substring method . 

I received some help from peers and luckily received good tips on how to start the application.

Unfortunately I did not complete the challenge and didn’t get to meet most of the acceptance criteria.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
