# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The overall goal of this project was to build a resourceful and easy to use study guide for a student learning to code.

The study guide‚Äôs purpose is meant to neatly organize all of the student‚Äôs notes. It also allows them to practice some of the things that they have learned which leads them to develop their coding skills.

While developing this project there were times where certain things didn‚Äôt make sense at first, but the majority of the time I knew that I could find the answer as long as I exercised patience and looked in the right area. I kept myself motivated by telling myself that there always had to be an answer somewhere, I just had to find it. With so many resources available on the internet and dozens of useful articles on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I learned that this project was going to be manageable as long as I kept at it.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
